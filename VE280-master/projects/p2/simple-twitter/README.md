This solution is only for reference, it can not compile on JOJ because
+ C++ FileSystem Library is used but it's not linked on JOJ
+ These STL Containers are used but they are not allowed in this project
  + `vector`
  + `map`
  + `set`
  + `unordered_map`
  + `unordered_set`
+ C++ Smart Pointers and `algorithm` are used but they are not allowed in this project

However, you can learn a lot about these things in this solution, which may be helpful in the future.
